# ðŸš€ ExamplePipelineCICDWithGithube  (with GitHub Actions Build â†’ Test â†’ Deploy)

This project demonstrates a simple HTML web page deployed through a **multi-job GitHub Actions workflow**. The CI/CD pipeline automatically performs **build**, **test**, and **deploy** jobs on every push to the `main` branch.

## ðŸ›  GitHub Actions Workflow Overview

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and includes:

- **Build job**: Simulates building the project
- **Test job**: Runs after the build job to simulate tests
- **Deploy job**: Executes only after both build and test succeed

### ðŸ“„ Workflow YAML

```yaml
name: multi-job-demo-with-Nader

Build: Checks out the code and simulates a build step.

Test: Runs after the build job to simulate testing.

Deploy: Executes only after both build and test complete successfully, simulating deployment of index.html.
